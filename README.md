## Project

The project `Panoramax` (https://panoramax.fr) is usualy presented as the OpenSource french version of Google Street View. It is a colaborative database of street georeferenced photographies. Around this main project, `Panneau(rama)x` extracts road signs from this database in order to update the `BD TOPOÂ®` of IGN (https://geoservices.ign.fr/bdtopo).

This process takes place in several stages:

- Detect and classify road signs
- Geolocalize road sign
- Store in database

Our objectives are the last part of this project. We try to localize road signs with a convinient precision, and to manage dupplications before to create a `road signs database`
